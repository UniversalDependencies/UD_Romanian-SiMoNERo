# Summary

SiMoNERo is a medical corpus of contemporary Romanian.

# Introduction


SiMoNERo contains texts from three medical subdomains: cardiology, diabetes, endocrinology. The texts come from scientific books, journal articles and blog posts, but predominant are those coming from books.
The texts dispaly the following levels of annotation: tokenization, POS tagging, lemmatization, syntactic parsing and medical Named Entities. All levels, except for the syntactic one, are hand validated. The description of the corpus creation (excluding the syntactic annotation) is presented in Mitrofan et al. (2019).
The syntactic parsing was made with the NLP Cube (https://github.com/adobe/NLP-Cube) system.
